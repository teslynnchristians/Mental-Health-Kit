Mental Health Kit - Let's improve our mental health together.

Introduction

The Project

Everyone struggling with mental health needs a strong community behind them . This is why I created Mental Health Kit.

Mental Health Kit is a site where those struggling with mental health can communicate with others suffering with the same mental illness or different mental illness. They can share their struggles as well as participate in activities to help them control their episodes. They can also get more information about the mental illness they suffer from. They can also make notes on the app when the activity helps them or what they did differently from the activity to help them .

Owners can craete a profile and direct message others to communicate with them and also share activities that could help them.
