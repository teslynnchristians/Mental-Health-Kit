Introduction

The Project

Everyone struggling with mental health needs a strong community behind them . This is why I created Mental Health Kit.

Mental Health Kit is a site where those struggling with mental health can communicate with others suffering with the same mental illness or different mental illness. They can share their struggles as well as participate in activities to help them control their episodes. They can also get more information about the mental illness they suffer from. 
Other features is they can add anything to their profile or they can edit their profile.

The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
