                   <h5 style="text-align:center;">Inspiration for the project</h5>
                   <p>I have been struggling with mental health for about 3 years and has some family members and family who struggles with mental health. That's why I decided to create this app. As a student of ALX , I had the opportunity to work on this project as part of my portfolio. However, this idea for this project came from my own personal experience and the need to better my mental health.
