                            <p>The project was inspired by myself ,some family members and friend. I have been suffering from anxiety as well as social anxiety for the last 3 years. My friend suffers from anxiety as well and some of my family members suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression,social anxiety and self harm. So project this project was inspired by all of us.
